cards.data: 
    list of cards in game

playerCards.data:
    list of cards in player inventory; 5 cards
    tip: copy name from cards.data to prevent typos

enemyCards.data:
    list of cards in enemy inventory; 5 cards or all (if enemy cards unknown)
    (litterally write "all" into file for all cards; increases computation time by a lot)
    same as playerCards.data

Args (in order): -MaxDepthOverride
Example: <exe> 3
    to set MaxDepth at turn 1 to 3
    simply starting exe sets this to standard
        standard is 8 (all turns) if enemy cards are known
                    (8 - CardCount/10) if enemy cards are unknown (5 for provided set);
                        maxDepth increases by 2 each turn (since the possibillities are a lot less)
        0 < maxDepth < 9
        
populateEnemyCards.py
    program to add enemy cards to "enemyCards.data" using provided directional values
    Order of values: up, right, bottom, left
    (repeated 5 times since every player is supposed to have 5 cards)
